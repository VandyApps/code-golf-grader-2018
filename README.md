# VandyApps Code Golf Grader
## How to use
To run this grader, you must have node installed on your machine. All you need to do is run `node ./grader.js` or `node ./grader.js gui` in the command line. This will start the GUI version. If you wish to use only the command line version then type `node ./grader.js cmd`, but as of now the command line version is not working properly.
